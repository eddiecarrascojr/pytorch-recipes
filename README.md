# PyTorch Recipes for a Portfolio
A Repo of 5 simple but useful PyTorch projects you can use to show off in a portfolio. 

## 1. Image Classification with Transfer Learning
Summary: Fine-tune a pre-trained model (like ResNet or EfficientNet) on a custom dataset (e.g., plant diseases, dog breeds, food items).
Skills: PyTorch basics, CNNs, transfer learning, data augmentation, evaluation metrics.

Code can be found (here).[Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning]

## 2. NLP Sentiment Analyzer with LSTM or Transformers
Summary: Build a sentiment analysis model on a dataset like IMDB, Yelp, or Twitter using LSTM, GRU, or HuggingFace Transformers.
Skills: Text preprocessing, embeddings, RNNs or Transformers, sentiment classification.


## 3. Tabular Data Predictive Modeling
Summary: Use a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI) to predict house prices, credit risk, or customer churn.
Skills: Handling missing data, feature engineering, neural networks for tabular data, model interpretability.

Bonus: Compare your model to XGBoost or LightGBM results.

## 4. Image-to-Image Translation with GANs
Summary: Train a Pix2Pix or CycleGAN model to convert sketches to colored images, day to night, or maps to satellite photos.
Skills: GANs, image processing, model training stability, creative applications.

## 5. Time Series Forecasting
Summary: Forecast stock prices, energy consumption, or weather trends using a combination of LSTM, CNN, or Transformer models.
Skills: Time series preprocessing, sequential modeling, PyTorch DataLoaders for sequences.
