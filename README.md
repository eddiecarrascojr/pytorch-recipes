# PyTorch Recipes for a Portfolio
PyTorch has become the leading Deep Learning Framework. Since Deep Learning is taking over and becoming more common than TensorFlow. Here is a few examples projects to get started with PyTorch [ecosystem](https://opensource.fb.com/projects/pytorch/). 

## Adding more Projects
As cooler ideas in ML come into play more ideas will be added here to the collection.
These are projects to be added.
- Building a ChatGPT using Wikipedia Data.
- Build an LLM using OpenAI.
- Create an AI agent using PyTorch and OpenAI.

A Repo of 5 simple but useful PyTorch projects you can use to show off in a portfolio. 

## 1. Image Classification with Transfer Learning
Summary: Fine-tune a pre-trained model (like ResNet or EfficientNet) on a custom dataset (e.g., plant diseases, dog breeds, food items).
Skills: PyTorch basics, CNNs, transfer learning, data augmentation, evaluation metrics.

Paper: [Transfer Learning applications](https://paperswithcode.com/task/transfer-learning)

Code can be found [here](/Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning/image-classicifcation-transfer-learning.py)

## 2. NLP Sentiment Analyzer with a Transformers
Summary: Build a sentiment analysis model on a dataset like IMDB data using  HuggingFace Transformers.
Skills: Text preprocessing, embeddings Transformers, sentiment classification.

Paper: [Attention is all you need](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/file/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Paper.pdf)

## 3. Tabular Data Predictive Modeling
Summary: Use a real-world dataset (e.g., from Kaggle or UCI) to predict house prices, credit risk, or customer churn.
Skills: Handling missing data, feature engineering, neural networks for tabular data, model interpretability. Bonous compare XGBoost and this model.
